# iswc18-tutorial

Materials **under development** for the [Tutorial on Hybrid Techniques for Knowledge-based NLP](http://expertsystemlab.com/hybridNLP18).

## Description of the tutorial
The intended length of the tutorial is half day, with plenty of practical content and examples. We plan to have an interactive session where both instructors and participants can engage in rich discussions on the topic. We will close with some time for discussion. Some familiarity on the matter is expected but otherwise this should not prevent potential attendees from coming. The agenda will address the following main points.

  * Capturing meaning from text as word embeddings.
  * Extending word embeddings with structured knowledge.
  * Building a vecsigrafo â€“ bringing knowledge from text into knowledge graphs.
  * Evaluating vecsigrafos beyond visual inspection and intrinsic methods.
  * Applications in cross-lingual natural language processing.
  * Beyond text understanding: Cross-modal extensions.
